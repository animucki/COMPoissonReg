# To Do

Improving computation of z-function
* May need adaptive code to compute other z-like functions
* Or... put the max argument back in
* For couple example, FIM and Hessian seem to give very different vcovs ...
* May not want to use FIM as default variance method anymore (consider Hessian)
* Retest everything
